== LCBO app: Project overview

In this Bitmaker Labs project, I used data fetched from the LCBO API to present users with items in their area (they input a postal code) that are on sale or other promotion. I created a gem to isolate the API calls. The gem is functional though not polished and is embedded in this repository as well.
